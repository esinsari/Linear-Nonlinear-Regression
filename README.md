# Single-Variable-Nonlinear-Regression

Packages
--> Import numpy, pandas, and pyplot.

Data Preparation for regression task
--> Load data for nonlinear regression. 
--> Generate the scatter plot of the data.
--> "data_nonlinear.csv"

Single Variable Nonlinear Regression
--> Develop a regression model, estimate coefficients with data, and derive the relationship.
--> Compute MSE loss with observation-prediction pairs.
--> Implement Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to achieve optimal solution with the learning rate of 0.0001 and 10000 epochs.

Prediction Results
--> Derive prediction function with the obtained coefficients.
